1. drag spider object into scene 
2. in spider, add component Nav Mesh Agent
2.5. see enemy.png for my settings for this component
3. create one layer for ground, one layer for player (you can name it however, just make sure yk what u named it)
4. create a capsule or sphere object, make it a prefab called enemy projectile or something
5. create an empty game object called NavMesh
6. in your plane/ground object make sure its set to the ground layer, player is set to player layer
6.5. note, for player, i made it the object mismo in the layer, not the empty game object player parent coz we will be referencing the position of the player obj 
7. add component called NavMesh Surface, in object collection dropdown, in include layers, first select Nothing
7.5 after youve selected nothing, now select ground layer and player layer, these should be the two layers in include layers
8. still in NavMesh Surface, click bake, and this should make your whole plane light blue (see plane.png for ref)
9. if you check the Awake() func in EnemyAI, theres a GameObject.Find() line there, make sure the string is the name of the player object you have
10. add the EnemyAI script to your spider enemy, make sure you set the empty fields (ground layer, player layer, projectile, agent(spider), player obj etc), see enemy.png
