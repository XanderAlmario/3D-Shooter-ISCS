0.5: Set the Active Input Handling to "Both" in project settings. Make an environment to move around (make a plane for the ground, cube and cylinder for obstacles, etc.; all found when you right click the hierarchy and hover over 3D Object)

STEPS FOR PLAYER
1. Create an empty object called "Player" and add a Character Controller component to it. Make the camera a child of said object
2. Make an object to signify the player and make it a child of the Player object as well (I used capsule)
3. Make a cube object to act as an "arrow" to point where the player is facing. Make this a child of the capsule and place it as a nose facing forward(direction of the blue arrow) 
4. Adjust the camera to have an OTS shot of the player (see image for reference)
5. Add the PlayerMovement to the Player object and fill in the respective serialize fields
