0.5: Set the Active Input Handling to "Both" in project settings. Make an environment to move around (make a plane for the ground, cube and cylinder for obstacles, etc.; all found when you right click the hierarchy and hover over 3D Object)

STEPS FOR PLAYER
1. Create an empty object called "Player" and add a Character Controller component to it. Add the PlayerMovementCM and Aiming scripts to this object as well.
2. Install Cinemachine (Window > Package Management > Package Manager and search for Cinemachine to install) and right click on the hierarchy then go to
Cinemachine > Cinemachine camera to create a Cinemachine(CM) cam
3. Under the Player object, create an empty object called "CameraTarget," then in the inspector of the CM cam, drag that CameraTarget to the "Tracking
Target" field
4. Adjust the CameraTarget to have an OTS shot of the player (see image for reference)
5. In CM cam inspector, set "Position Control" to "Third Person Follow," then under "CM Third Person Follow"(new component), set all the dampings to 0
6. Go back to Player and set all the serialized fields of PlayerMovementCM
- Controller: Drag Character Controller of Player object to it
- Ground: Select the ground layer(note that the plane for the ground needs to be in the same layer)
7. Set serialized fields of Aiming
